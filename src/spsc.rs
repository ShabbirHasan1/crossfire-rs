//! Single producer, single consumer.
//!
//! The optimization assumes a single producer and consumer, so waker registration is completely lockless.
//!
//! **NOTE**: For the SP/SC version, [AsyncTx], [AsyncRx], [Tx], and [Rx] are not `Clone` and do not implement `Sync`.
//! Although they can be moved to other threads, they are not allowed to be used with `send`/`recv` while in an `Arc`.
//!
//! The following code is OK:
//!
//! ``` rust
//! use crossfire::*;
//! async fn foo() {
//!     let (tx, rx) = spsc::bounded_async::<usize>(100);
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!          let _ = tx.send(2).await;
//!     });
//!     drop(rx);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Because the `AsyncTx` does not have the `Sync` marker, using `Arc<AsyncTx>` will lose the `Send` marker.
//!
//! For your safety, the following code **should not compile**:
//!
//! ``` compile_fail
//! use crossfire::*;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! async fn foo() {
//!     let (tx, rx) = spsc::bounded_async::<usize>(100);
//!     let tx = Arc::new(tx);
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!          let _ = tx.send(2).await;
//!     });
//!     drop(rx);
//! }
//! ```
